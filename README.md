# Hello World eBPF Demo

This project demonstrates a simple eBPF program that attaches to system call tracepoints and prints informational messages. It is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to eBPF programming.

## Overview

This demo project:

- Attaches an eBPF program to the `sys_enter_execve` tracepoint.
- Prints a "Hello World" message whenever the `execve` system call is invoked.

The code demonstrates basic eBPF development concepts, such as program attachment and tracepoint interaction.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, ensure the following requirements are met:

1. **System Requirements:**
   - Linux kernel version 5.4 or later with eBPF support enabled.
   - `clang` and `llvm` installed for compiling eBPF programs.
   - GCC or another C compiler for linking.

2. **Tools:**
   - [bpf2go](https://github.com/cilium/ebpf) (part of the `cilium/ebpf` project).
   - `make` for build automation.
   - `git` for version control.

3. **Permissions:**
   - Root privileges are required to load and execute eBPF programs.

4. **Optional (for debugging):**
   - `bpftool` for inspecting eBPF programs.

Install necessary tools on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y clang llvm gcc make git
```

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hello_world-demo.git
cd hello_world-demo
```

---

## Compilation

Build the eBPF program and the Go executable using the `Makefile`:

```bash
sudo make build
```

This command:

- Generates Go bindings from the eBPF program using `bpf2go`.
- Compiles the Go program into a binary named `demo`.

---

## Execution

Run the compiled executable with root privileges:

```bash
sudo ./demo
```

Upon execution:

- The program attaches the eBPF program to the `sys_enter_execve` tracepoint.
- It prints messages to the kernel log whenever the `execve` syscall is triggered.

### Viewing Kernel Logs

To view the output of the eBPF program:

```bash
dmesg | tail -n 20
```

### What it does -

The `dmesg` command prints the kernel ring buffer, which contains messages generated by the Linux kernel.
These messages often include:

- System initialization logs (e.g., hardware detection during boot).
- Kernel events (e.g., module loading, driver initialization).
- Warnings or errors from the kernel.
- Logs generated by kernel-level programs, like eBPF programs that use `bpf_printk`.
